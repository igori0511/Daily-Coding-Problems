#This problem was asked by Palantir.

#Write an algorithm to justify text. Given a sequence of words and an integer line length k, 
#return a list of strings which represents each line, fully justified.

#More specifically, you should have as many words as possible in each line. There should be at least one space between each word. 
#Pad extra spaces when necessary so that each line has exactly length k. 
#Spaces should be distributed as equally as possible, with the extra spaces, if any, distributed starting from the left.

#If you can only fit one word on a line, then you should pad the right-hand side with spaces.

#Each word is guaranteed not to be longer than k.

#For example, given the list of words ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"] and k = 16, you should return the following:

#["the  quick brown", # 1 extra space on the left
#"fox  jumps  over", # 2 extra spaces distributed evenly
#"the   lazy   dog"] # 4 extra spaces distributed evenly
