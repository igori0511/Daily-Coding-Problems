#This problem was asked by Google.

#Given a singly linked list and an integer k, remove the kth last element from the list. 
#k is guaranteed to be smaller than the length of the list.

#The list is very long, so making more than one pass is prohibitively expensive.
#Do this in constant space and in one pass.
